# AI-Court

AI-Court is an innovative project designed to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist in analyzing and interpreting court cases. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Web Development techniques to offer insightful analyses of legal documents.

## Features

- **Court Case Analyzer**: An AI-powered tool that can analyze court cases and offer insights based on case law and previous judgments.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies key entities in legal texts, such as case numbers, lawyers, judges, and more.
- **Relation Extraction (RE)**: Extracts relationships between different entities in legal cases to uncover connections between judgments.
- **Summarization**: Uses advanced AI techniques to summarize long legal cases for easy understanding.
- **UI for User Interaction**: A web-based user interface for interacting with the AI-powered case analysis system.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend development and AI processing.
- **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly web interface to interact with the application.
- **TensorFlow**: For model training and AI analysis.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Git LFS**: For managing large files such as datasets and models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For text processing and entity recognition.
- **Machine Learning**: For model fine-tuning and prediction.
